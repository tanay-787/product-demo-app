# Miniature Full-Stack Collaborative Product Demo Platform

Build a miniature full-stack version of a collaborative product demo platform inspired by **Arcade**. This task tests your ability to design, build, and deploy a modern web application that enables users to create and share interactive product stories.


Short about Arcade:

Arcade is a leading interactive demo platform that enables teams to create visually engaging, interactive product demos with minimal effort. The platform automates the demo creation process by recording user actions‚Äîsuch as clicks and scrolls‚Äîcapturing screens, and assembling these into seamless, interactive product stories.

Key features include:

Effortless Demo Creation: Quickly build interactive demos without advanced technical skills.

Visual Editing: Add annotations, tooltips, and step transitions to enhance clarity.

Multi-Channel Sharing: Share demos via websites, blogs, emails, or social media, and export as video or GIF.

Analytics: Track viewer engagement to optimize demos for conversion and adoption.

Integrations: Connect with tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, Figma, and Slack for seamless workflows.

Collaboration: Manage workspaces, permissions, and branding for teams of any size.

Arcade is widely used by marketers, product managers, sales teams, and support professionals to showcase products, educate users, and drive product-led growth by allowing prospects to interact with products before making a purchase.
